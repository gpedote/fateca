Installation
==============

There are two ways of setting up the dev environment.

Automated Process
-------------------

This way is prefered because it will easily provide a common dev environment. Automatically creating a VM machine for you and configuring everything.

First of all, make sure you have installed the [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) on your PC, then you should clone the repository via git in your computer or [download it](https://github.com/gpedote/fateca/archive/master.zip).

Then via prompt or shell:
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
```
Later:
```
vagrant up
```
Just wait until the whole process is over. Then fire up your favorite browser and access: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
