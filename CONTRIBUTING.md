How to Contribute
===================

FATECA follows the [Github workflow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) and the [semantic versioning system](http://semver.org). With that in mind, if you would like to contribute, clone the source on GitHub make your changes and send me a pull request. If you are unable to fix the issue, create a ticket and we'll see what happens from there.
